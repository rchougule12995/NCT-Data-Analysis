			   <p>The dataset contains various attrributes like Vehicle Make, Model, their year of birth, number of vehicles manufactured in total and the various components in which the had undergone tests. 
			   In addition to that each of the quantitative attribute has a number/count along with its percentage associated. Example: PASS, PASS%. Pass denotes the total number of that vehicle model passed the overall National Car Testing. 
			   Whereas for all other components, it gives the number of vehicles failed in that test and percentage of failure. </p>

			   <p>
				This line chart shows the average failure percentage for each component for vehicles manufactured in the year 2016 by the top 10 vehicle manufacturers and their year of birth is after 1990.
				The line chart gives a general idea about the trend that is seen with the failure percentage relative to its year of birth.
				Hovering over the line will give exact average and the year of birth of the vehicle make, as its a bit difficult to interpret the exact numbers from viewing the visualisation at once.

			   <p>
				The visualisation gives a trend of how the average failure percentage of vehicles vary over different components during the testing of vehicles depending on the year of birth of the vehicle model.
				In general, we can observe, there are quite a few components like- Engine, Noise and Exhaust, Braking Equipments, Side Slip Tests, Emission Tests from a the large list of components show a significant drop over their year of birth.
				This trend could be due to the technology improvement in subsequent years, as new technologies were introduced in past decade or so there have been massive decrease in vehicle failure in specifically vehicle emissions & safety components like brakes, side slip test.
				Also, from comparing each of the failure components from the drop-down, its observed that failure due to Vehicle Safety equipments does not follow much similar trend.

				<p>
				I have used a Line chart in this visualisation as it is easier to understand a trend of various years by a line chart in a better way. The different facets in the graph give information on the Vehicle manufacturer/make.
				I have also added a drop down to change the different failure component attributes. The default that is set is the Engine, Noise and exhaust failure.
				The drop down has all the failure component attributes in percentage, on selection of the component from the dropdown the visualisation is plotted accordingly.

			   <p>
				The Data that I used in the first visualisation for comparing the vehicle manufacturing across their year of birth after the year 1990.
				More importantly, the vehicle manufacturers that I have filtered to use include only those which we identified as the top vehicle manufacturers in the year 2016.
				We have focused on the data for the top 10 manufacturers itself in the earlier analysis and will use the same in this as well.
